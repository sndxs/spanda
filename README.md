# spanda
An enhanced version of pandas, suited to the particular needs i have in the educational world. 
One big enhancement is to program better the __getitem__ function in order to authomatize the construction
of joins and retrieval of data from different files, in order to avoid pre-contruction of joins and big tables 
with too many columns and build the panda on the fly.
